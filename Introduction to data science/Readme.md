# DATA 601 - Fall 2024
Homework Assignment 1
Total Points: 30

Work Summary

For this assignment, I completed a series of Python programming tasks:

1. Trigonometric Calculations: 
   - Calculated and printed the secant of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) using the `math` library without a direct `sec` function.
   - Used the formula \( \text{sec} = \frac{1}{\cos} \).

2. String Manipulation:
   - Converted a string of dollar prices to yen prices using a given exchange rate.
   - Replaced dollar signs with yen symbols and rounded the values to two decimal places.

3. Working with Lists and the `names` Package:
   - Created lists of random first and last names using the `names` package.
   - Modified the lists by removing and adding names, including inserting and appending new names.

4. Pattern Printing:
   - Generated a specific pattern using loops and conditional statements.
   - Printed stars and spaces to create a mirrored hourglass shape.

Notes:
- The `names` package was installed and used to generate random first and last names.
- The exchange rate used for converting dollars to yen was mentioned in the comments.
- The final outputs and patterns were printed as specified in the instructions.
