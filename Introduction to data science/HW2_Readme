# Homework Assignment 2 - DATA 601 (Fall 2024)

This repository contains solutions to Homework Assignment 2 for the DATA 601 course. The tasks focus on recursion, polynomial evaluation, and solving quadratic equations using Python.

## Tasks Overview
1. Recursive Dot Product: A function to calculate the dot product of two vectors recursively.
2. Polynomial Class: A class to evaluate polynomials from a list of monomials.
3. Quadratic Equation Solver: A class that extends `Polynomial` to solve quadratic equations and find roots.

## Code Details
### Task 1: Recursive Dot Product
A recursive function calculates the dot product of two vectors without using loops.

### Task 2: Polynomial Class
The `Polynomial` class evaluates multi-variable polynomials. It takes monomials in the format `[coefficient, variables, degrees]`.

### Task 3: Quadratic Equation Solver
The `Quadratic_Eq` class inherits from `Polynomial` and solves single-variable quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.

## How to Run
1. Clone the code file repository.
2. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook in your environment.
3. Review the outputs for each task.

## Notes
- Handles both real and complex roots for quadratic equations.
- This is an assignment given by my professor as part of the semester.
